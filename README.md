# react-native-poc
For this project I used 'Rick & Morty' REST API which is based on television series 'Rick & Morty', to fetch the characters list and episode appearing details of every character. I used lazy loading for rendering character list, other than that feature used pull to refresh, modal popup, searching etc. Environment used  react native CLI.
